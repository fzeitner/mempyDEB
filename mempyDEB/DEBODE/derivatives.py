    Derivatives of the "DEBBase" model. <br>
    DEBBase is a formulation of DEBkiss with maturity, where structure is expressed as mass (instead of volume). <br>
    The TKTD part assumes log-logistic relationships between scaled damage and the relative response. <br>
    There is no explicit representation of "stress". Instead, we compute the relative response directly by applying the appropriate form of the dose-response function.
    This is the same model formulation as used in the Julia package DEBBase.jl.
